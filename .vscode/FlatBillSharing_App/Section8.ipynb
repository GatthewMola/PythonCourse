    "We are now back to the drawing board. We currently have scrap code in for the return method in the \"pays\" method. We need to trash this code and figure out a formula that will calculate a flatmate's bill given the amount of the total bill and the # of days they've spent in the flat.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say the total bill is $120. If both flatmates have spent the same number of days living in the flat, they will pay the same ratio of the bill (50/50 split, i.e. $60 each).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if the flatmate's have spent a differing amount of time in the flat, we will need to find the coefficient of the # of days each has spent (i.e. day1 / day1 + day2). The coefficient for the other flat mate will be the opposite of the previous formula. From this coefficient, we can determine the bill for that roommate (120 * coefficient)."
